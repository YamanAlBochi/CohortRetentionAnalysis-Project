# CohortRetentionAnalysis-Project

- Retention Churn Rate is defined as the number of customers who continue to use a product/services, its measured as the number of returning users, at a regular interval such as every week or month, grouped by their week of signup, in this project I'll be exploring an online retail dataset and create a retention cohort analysis in Python.


- What is Cohort Analysis?

A type of Statistical Analysis in which groups or 'Cohorts' of users are tracked through time to observe specific outcomes, the best way to think about cohort analysis, is that it's a form of experimentation to perform a Cohort Analysis, a company must first describe a hypothesis to test such a hypothesis that might be a new feature that will reduce churn rate. For example; a company will construct an experiment to monitor and such hypothesis over time, and as part of this experiment and design a company will have to define its user groups or cohorts for the experimentation to run, they do this by defining a unique characteristic that will define their cohorts. 

The data a user signing up online or creating an account, would be a good exapmle of this, a company will run the experiment based on the groups that they've defined and then they'll work out when they churn over time, finally once the company collected the data that they need, they'll display it in a format similar to this chart we have below.
