# CohortRetentionAnalysis-Project
Retention Rate is defined as the number of customers who continue to use a product/service. Retention rate is measured as the number of returning users, at a regular interval such as every week or month, grouped by their week of signup, in this project I'll be exploring an online retail dataset and create a retention cohort analysis in SQL (Server) and Tableau.
